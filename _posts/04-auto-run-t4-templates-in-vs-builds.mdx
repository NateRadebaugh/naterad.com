title: How to Auto-Run T4 Templates in Visual Studio Builds
description: T4 templates can be used to auto-generate code, such as creating TypeScript types from C# class/enums. Remove the manual step by automatically running your templates as part of the build process.

In **Visual Studio**, a **T4 text template** is a mixture of text blocks and control logic that can generate a text file. The control logic is written as fragments of program code in Visual C# or Visual Basic.

The generated file can be text of any kind, such as a web page, or a resource file, or program source code in any language.

## Set up your T4 template in your project

1. Add reference to your T4 templates in your `.csproj` file:

   ```xml
   <ItemGroup>
        <Content Include="Models\Model.tt">
            <Generator>TextTemplatingFileGenerator</Generator>
            <LastGenOutput>Model.ts</LastGenOutput>
        </Content>
   </ItemGroup>
   ```

   - Note: This is not supported in your `.njsproj`, so this needs to live in your `.csproj`

1. Write your T4 Templates to write the output that you want.

   - Test this by right-clicking the `.tt` file in Visual Studio and choosing `Run Custom Tool`

## Automate it

This is great, but requiring manual intervention for code generation is so 2019.

1. Install NuGet package `Mono.TextTransform`

   - https://www.nuget.org/packages/Mono.TextTransform/

1. Run your T4 Text Transforms after the C# code builds:

   - Add the following `PostBuildEvent` `BackEnd.csproj`:

   ```xml
   <PropertyGroup>
       <PostBuildEvent>"$(SolutionDir)packages\Mono.TextTransform.1.0.0\tools\TextTransform.exe" "$(ProjectDir)Models\Model.tt" -a=outDir!"$(TargetDir)$(ConfigurationName)\"</PostBuildEvent>
   </PropertyGroup>
   ```

## Success!

Now when you build, your generated output will be re-generated after the build succeeds. Whew! ðŸ˜…

### What about pre-build events?

If you need to run your T4 template before the build, such as for T4 MVC, you'll want to use a `<PreBuildEvent>` instead of the `<PostBuildEvent>` above in your `.csproj` file.
