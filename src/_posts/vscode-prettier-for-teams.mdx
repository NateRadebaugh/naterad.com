Hit the ground running with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode) by installing the best extensions to make you productive.

While **Visual Studio 2019** is a great IDE, its support for modern web development front-end toolkits is lacking. One such integration that is fairly incomplete in Visual Studio 2019 is integration with is the [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) code formatter.

## Installation

Install through VS Code extensions. Search for `Prettier - Code formatter`

Visual Studio Code Market Place: `Prettier - Code formatter`

Can also be installed in VS Code:

1. Launch VS Code Quick Open (Ctrl+P)
2. Paste the following command
   ```shell
   ext install esbenp.prettier-vscode
   ```
3. Press enter.

## Configuration

- Format on Save

  1. From VSCode, open **"File > Preferences > Settings"**
  2. Choose the level of setting you'd like to manage:

     - `User` (applies to all workspaces on this machine)
     - OR `Workspace` (applies to just this workspace)

  3. Search for `format on save`

     - Check **`Editor: Format on Save`** if it isn't already checked

- Require Prettier config to avoid mistakenly formatting files that are not explicitly opted in to using prettier.

  1. From VSCode, open **"File > Preferences > Settings"**
  2. Choose the level of setting you'd like to manage:

     - `User` (applies to all workspaces on this machine)
     - OR `Workspace` (applies to just this workspace)

  3. Search for `prettier`

     - Scroll down and find `Prettier: Require Config`
     - Check **`Prettier: Require Config`** if it isn't already checked

## Explanation

Visual Studio will now look for a prettier config and, if it finds one, will format the file any time you save! Don't worry about tabbing or semicolons again -- prettier will handle all the heavy lifting.

### Prettier Configuration files

Prettier (and its VSCode extension supports) a number of [configuration files](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html):

- A `"prettier"` key in your `package.json` file.
- A `.prettierrc` file, written in JSON or YAML, with optional extensions: `.json/.yaml/.yml` (without extension takes precedence).
- A `.prettierrc.js` or `prettier.config.js` file that exports an object.
- A `.prettierrc.toml` file, written in TOML (the `.toml` extension is required).

### I recommend...

**I recommend** using all the prettier defaults, and creating a `.prettierrc` file in the topmost directory in your project you want to use prettier with

An empty `.prettierrc` file will do the trick to enable auto-formatting.

```json title=.prettierrc
{}
```

### Gradually migrating large projects to prettier

Once added benefit to the `Prettier: Require Config` setting in VSCode if you're working with a large project that hasn't fully been migrated to use prettier for the whole setup, adding directory-level configuration files enables granular migration to prettier.
