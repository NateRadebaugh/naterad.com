I had this same question, and ended up on this StackOverflow Question/Answer

## ‚ùì Question

> I have looked into Bootstrap, and noticed that there are few "color classes" included (primary, success, danger etc.) I would like to know if there is a way to add more classes like those mentioned in easy way.
>
> For example: "primary" can be used with many elements, and will apply the defined color, and so does the other color classes. Can I create a class named "important", define its colors and apply it everywhere just like the included classes, without making a version of it for each element individually (using plain css or any of the preprocessors )

## üëæ Accepted answer

The main accepted answer suggests manually writing raw CSS to explicitly implement each new class yourself. This can work, and I've certainly used hacks like this myself on a variety of projects. However, there are obvious downsides to this approach, including duplicate code, manually calculating color codes for various states, and the dreaded `!important` hammer!

```css
@import url("https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/css/bootstrap.min.css");

.important,
.important a {
  color: #fff !important;
  background-color: #ffc107 !important;
  border-color: #ff9800 !important;
}
.important:active,
.important.active,
.important:focus,
.important.focus,
.important:hover,
.important a:hover {
  background-color: #ff9800 !important;
  border-color: #ff5722 !important;
}
```

## ‚úîÔ∏è A Better Way

This is an older question but the accepted answer isn't the most complete and/or future-proof. Here's what I'd recommend if you've got SASS compilation as part of your build step.

For example, if you want to add a new "tertiary" color to the generated CSS classes, eg `.text-tertiary`, `.bg-tertiary`, `.alert-tertiary`, etc. we can use the following steps:

1. Set up a `.scss` file that will contain all of your SCSS and bootstrap overrides.

```
@import "_variables";
@import "~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss";
```

2. Create your `_variables.scss` file for your bootstrap variable configurations/overrides:

```scss
$tertiary: #218f8b;

// Add "tertiary" styles to the generated classes
$theme-colors: (
  "tertiary": $tertiary,
);
```
