# Monorepos are great.

Monorepos let us version our back-end with our front-end, making compability easy with combined builds and deployments using a shared CI/CD pipeline. They also let us make assumptions about relative relationships between folders during development.

# How to Merge Two Git Repositories into a Monorepo (without losing history)

It is easier than you think to merge two separate repositories into one.

Say you have `RepositoryA` and `RepositoryB`, which you want to merge to create `RepositoryC:`

- `RepositoryA`:

  ```dir
  \
      \.gitignore
      \webpack.config.js
      \tslint.json
  ```

- `RepositoryB`:

  ```dir
  \
      \.gitignore
      \Program.cs
  ```

- New `RepositoryC`:

  ```dir {2,3,6}
  \
      \.gitignore
      \RepositoryA
          \webpack.config.js
          \tslint.json
      \RepositoryB
          \Program.cs
  ```

You'll notice from the above differences that we have a few steps required:

1.  In `RepositoryA`,
    1. Move the contents of `RepositoryA` into a sub-directory `RepositoryA` (except `.gitignore`)
       - Check this into a new branch for `RepositoryA`
       - **Note:** This should show as every file being a `RENAME` in git.
    2. Push to origin:
       - `git push -u origin HEAD`
2.  In `RepositoryB`,
    1. Move the contents of `RepositoryB` into a sub-directory `RepositoryB` (except `.gitignore`)
       - Check this into a new branch for `RepositoryB`
       - **Note:** This should show as every file being a `RENAME` in git.
    2. Push to origin:
       - `git push -u origin HEAD`
3.  In `RepositoryC`,

    1.  Initialize your new repository (maybe clone an existing empty repository)
        ```shell
        c:\RepositoryC>  git remote -v
        origin  https://some-example@dev.azure.com/some-example/some-example/_git/RepositoryC (fetch)
        origin  https://some-example@dev.azure.com/some-example/some-example/_git/RepositoryC (push)
        ```
    2.  Create an initial commit (maybe add a `README.md` file)
    3.  Add `RepositoryA` and `RepositoryB` as remotes

        - Run:

          ```shell
          c:\RepositoryC>  git remote add repository-a https://some-example@dev.azure.com/some-example/some-example/_git/RepositoryA
          c:\RepositoryC>  git remote add repository-b https://some-example@dev.azure.com/some-example/some-example/_git/RepositoryA
          ```

        - After:

          ```shell
          c:\RepositoryC>  git remote -v
          repository-a     https://some-example@dev.azure.com/some-example/some-example/_git/RepositoryA (fetch)
          repository-a     https://some-example@dev.azure.com/some-example/some-example/_git/RepositoryA (push)
          repository-b     https://some-example@dev.azure.com/some-example/some-example/_git/RepositoryB (fetch)
          repository-b     https://some-example@dev.azure.com/some-example/some-example/_git/RepositoryB (push)
          origin  https://some-example@dev.azure.com/some-example/some-example/_git/RepositoryC (fetch)
          origin  https://some-example@dev.azure.com/some-example/some-example/_git/RepositoryC (push)
          ```

    4.  Fetch the latest from these newly references remotes

        ```shell
        c:\RepositoryC>  git fetch repository-a
        * [new branch]      master     -> repository-a/master

        c:\RepositoryC>  git fetch repository-b
        * [new branch]      master     -> repository-b/master
        ```

    5.  Merge each of these new branches into your repository

        ```shell
        c:\RepositoryC>  git merge repository-a/master --allow-unrelated-histories
        ```

        - **Note:** You may need to manually merge and commit your merge at this point, depending on what you initial commit to `RepositoryC` contained.

        ```shell
        c:\RepositoryC>  git merge repository-b/master --allow-unrelated-histories
        ```

        - **Note:** You may need to manually merge and commit your merge at this point, depending on what you initial commit to `RepositoryC` contained.

        > `--allow-unrelated-histories` is the magic sauce. [Read the docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#Documentation/git-merge.txt---allow-unrelated-histories)

    6.  At this point, you should have your new file structure containing the full history of both repositories into one. ðŸŽ‰
    7.  Push your new remote
        ```shell
        c:\RepositoryC>  git push -u origin HEAD
        ```
    8.  You did it!
