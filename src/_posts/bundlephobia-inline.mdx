Bundlephobia is an amazingly wonderful site that lets us know how big bundles are before using them.

While it's not much publicized, there's an API exposed to get some details for a given package:

`https://bundlephobia.com/api/size?package=<package-name>`

For example, the latest version of `react-query` returns the following values: `https://bundlephobia.com/api/size?package=react-query`:

```json {17,18,22,27}
{
  "assets": [
    {
      "gzip": 6104,
      "name": "main",
      "size": 19909,
      "type": "js"
    }
  ],
  "dependencyCount": 2,
  "dependencySizes": [
    {
      "approximateSize": 31288,
      "name": "react-query"
    }
  ],
  "description": "Hooks for managing, caching and syncing asynchronous and remote data in React",
  "gzip": 6104,
  "hasJSModule": "dist/react-query.mjs",
  "hasJSNext": false,
  "hasSideEffects": false,
  "name": "react-query",
  "peerDependencies": ["react"],
  "repository": "https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query.git",
  "scoped": false,
  "size": 19909,
  "version": "1.3.4"
}
```

As you can tell, we can get some useful details from this API 🤯!

You may be predicting the next step 💡, but I thought it would be helpful to create a component to show these details for a given package, with up-to-date details. Enter `bundlephobia-inline`, `<BundlephobiaInline />`, and `useBundlephobia()`!

```jsx
import BundlephobiaInline from "bundlephobia-inline";

<BundlephobiaInline packageName="react-query" />;
```

# I like that! 🤩

## What about other components?

The basic `BundlephobiaInline` component is super-opinionated and likely isn't what you'll want for every project. Instead, the `bundlephobia-inline` package also exposes the `useBundlephobia` hook for a wrapper around the bundlephobia API using `react-query`!

```jsx
import { useBundlephobia } from "bundlephobia-inline";
```

With some simple tweaking, you can even configure `.mdx` files to render `bundlephobia` codeblocks using this`<BundlephobiaInline />` component.
