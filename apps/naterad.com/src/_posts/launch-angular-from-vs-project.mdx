1. You'll want to make sure these settings are only going to apply when you're working with a Debug configuration, so it won't apply in production.

   ```xml
   <PropertyGroup>
       <Configuration Condition=" '$(Configuration)' == '' ">Debug</Configuration>
       // ...
   </PropertyGroup>
   ```

2. `.njsproj` doesn't know how to use your "start" or "dev" scripts from you `package.json`, so you'll need to explicitly list out the path to your CLI in the `<StartupFile>` tag.

   ```xml
   <StartupFile>node_modules\@angular\cli\bin\ng</StartupFile>
   ```

3. Adding arguments via `<StartupFile>` doesn't work, so you'll have to explicitly list them in the `<ScriptArguments>` tag instead.

   ```xml
   <ScriptArguments>serve --aot --open=true</ScriptArguments>
   ```

4. To avoid race conditions where VS tries to launch your app's server before the CLI is finished getting it started, you'll want to use the CLI's `--open=true` setting directly (instead of `<StartWebBrowser>`).

   ```xml
   <StartWebBrowser>false</StartWebBrowser>
   ```

Putting it all together, you'll end up with a `.njsproj` with something like this:

```xml:FrontEnd.njsproj {4-6}
<PropertyGroup>
    <Configuration Condition=" '$(Configuration)' == '' ">Debug</Configuration>
    // ...
    <StartupFile>node_modules\@angular\cli\bin\ng</StartupFile>
    <ScriptArguments>serve --aot --open=true</ScriptArguments>
    <StartWebBrowser>false</StartWebBrowser>
    // ...
  </PropertyGroup>
```
