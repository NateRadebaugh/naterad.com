To avoid one-off scripts or manual steps in deploying database schema changes, a database project can be helpful.

For code-first solutions, migrations are helpful for making sure your local database matches your code.

A manual schema-compare step keeps the database project in sync with your local database.

We then compile the database project to a format the Azure Pipelines understand, and automatically update DBs as part of deployments to keep data in sync.

If a database migration can't happen automatically, the deployment fails and is blocked.

## Code-first database updates

> Option a. Making DB updates (Code-first Migrations using .net core)

1. Update DB entity in C#
2. Run `add-migration asfasdf` to create a migration to get your DB to match your local C# entities
3. Run `update-database` to update your DB
4. Perform schema compare to update your database project's `.sql` files to match your local env
5. Do not check in your migration file, but do check in the DB snapshot file to ensure future migrations work correctly.

## DB-first database updates

> **or** Option b. Making DB updates (DB-first using .net core)

1. Manually update your DB
2. Perform schema compare to update your database project's `.sql` files to match your local env
3. Do not check in your migration file, but do check in the DB snapshot file to ensure future migrations work correctly.

## Initial Setup

1. Create a database project in VS
   - Note: configure your database project to use "Microsoft Azure SQL Database"
2. Perform an initial schema compare - `LocalToProject` or `DevelopmentToProject`
   - Note: do not include user or roles in the schema compare or you may impact security/access as you deploy to various environments.
3. Check in your changes to git
4. Add a build step to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file after your other build steps

   ```yml
   - task: VSBuild@1
   displayName: "Build database project"
   inputs:
      solution: "**/ProjectName.Database.sqlproj"
      msbuildArgs: '/p:OutputPath="$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)\drop-dacpac"'
      configuration: "$(BuildConfiguration)"
   ```

5. Add a deployment step to your release (before deploying your app)

   **Azure SQL Database deployment**

   - Azure Service Connection Type: `Azure Resource Manager`
   - Azure Subscription: `$(AzureSubscription)`
   - Authentication Type: `Connection String`
   - Connection String: `$(ConnectionString)`
   - DACPAC File: `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)\**\*Database.dacpac`
